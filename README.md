# mini-quadruped

This is an open source project for anyone who wants to research low-cost quadruped robotic platforms. 
A mathematical description, simulation and implementation of a three-dimensional quadruped robot, with six degrees 
of freedom on torso and multi-joint legs is discussed in this project. The equations to express rotations in 
combination with the inverse kinematics, allowed to derive an algorithm to find out the position of the 
multi-joint legs as a function of the torsoâ€™s orientation. By incorporating a gyroscope and accelerometer, and 
merging both measures is posible to obtain the orientation of the body in real time. Those values and the information 
collected via the webcam allowed to the robot to follow the position of the hand in real time.
